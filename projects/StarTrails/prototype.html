							<p>After presenting our low-fidelity prototypes to class and to our clients, we received
								numerous suggestions for improvement as summarized below:
							<ul>
								<li> For the bookmarked sites; it might be a good idea to have itâ€™s own separate page to
									allow people to bookmark a lot of sites</li>
								<li> Settings button on the splash screen is confusing and not required</li>
								<li> Users don't like intrusive questions regarding date and time they visited a site
								</li>
								<li> Review page is cluttered and needs to be shortened or simplified</li>
								<li> Have the restaurant not be reviewable </li>
								<li> Instead of saying "review" call it user contributed information or knowledge</li>
								<li> Leave out the survey part on the review</li>
								<li> Have two categories for sites visited and favorited sites</li>
							</ul>


							Upon careful consideration and integration of the majority of the feedback we received, our
							next step was the development of a high-fidelity prototype. High-fidelity prototypes are
							intricate representations of the final product, offering a detailed and realistic view of
							its features and functionality.
							We opted for Figma as our development tool and we selected it due to its usability and
							flexibility in regards to prototyping. Below, you'll find screenshots captured from our
							high-fidelity prototype, showcasing our home screen, discovery screen, browse sites screen
							and our site view screen. Moving forward, we will be focused on implementing the core
							functionality and the feedback we were given from our prototype into our final
							implementation.

											<figcaption style="font-size: 14px;">

											</figcaption>

											<p>Pictured above is our Discovery and Home screen, if the user were to
												click the home button on the bottom they would be redirected to the Home
												screen on the right where they can select stargazing sites from a map or
												view a list of popular sites. Additionally if the user chooses the
												compass button on the bottom they would be directed to the Discovery
												page on the left. Where the user could browse sites, view celestial
												events, or simply lookup tips and fact on stargazing.</p>

							</div>

							<p>We gathered incredible feedback from our clients and peers on these two screen
								specifically on how the home screen from the user perspective makes more sense as a
								discovery screen, and in the end we decided to "flip" the screens. In other words, we
								directed our home button to the discovery screen and our discovery button to the home
								screen.</p>

											</figcaption>

											<p>Pictured above is our site browsing and site view screens. As part of our
												core functionality, we needed to allow the users to browse different
												stargazing sites, and view detailed information regarding the site. The
												site view in particular, contains a vast array of information on a
												stargazing sites description, location, amenities, nearby businesses and
												a user feedback section. Our clients tasked us with finding a different
												word for "Review" or "Rating" to move away from a site having negative
												feedback. Moving forward and into implementation we plan to replace the
												word rating with "experience". Overall, we believe these designs will
												give us a good reference point when we reach the implementation stage
												and will help us visualize how we want our app to look.</p>
