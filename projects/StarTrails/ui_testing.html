                            <p>After implementing our major functionality and the majority of our user interface, we
                                conducted User-Interface tests to see which parts of our implementation worked well and
                                what aspects could or should be changed to create a better end product.</p>

                            <h2>Methods</h2>
                            <p>
                                Our User-Interface testing methodology comprised of: 
                            </p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Recruitment of Testers:</strong> We recruited a diverse group of six
                                    participants, each from different backgrounds and relationships with stargazing.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Scenarios & Tasks:</strong> We designed realistic scenarios and tasks to
                                    evaluate the app's core features and usability.</li>
                                <li><strong>Recording & Observation:</strong> We recorded screen activity using screen
                                    recording software and took notes on participant behavior and feedback.</li>
                                <li><strong>Feedback Gathering:</strong> Conducted post-test questionnaires and
                                    interviews to collect detailed feedback on user satisfaction and suggestions for
                                    improvement.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h2>Summary</h2>
                            <p>
                                Based on the user testing sessions conducted with six participants, here is a summary of
                                the findings:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Number of Testing Sessions:</strong> 6</li>
                                <li><strong>User Pairs:</strong> None (due to inability to recruit participants willing
                                    to work in pairs)</li>
                                <li><strong>Common Positive Feedback:</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Participants found the app to be relatively intuitive and easy to use,
                                            rating it an average of 8 out of 10.</li>
                                        <li>Users appreciated features like nearby sites, filter functionality, and the
                                            ability to access weather information.</li>
                                        <li>Distinction between visited and favorite sites was well-received.</li>
                                        <li>Participants liked the level of detail provided on site detail pages,
                                            including weather integration and light pollution data.</li>
                                        <li>Most users found functionalities like leaving comments and setting
                                            notifications to be straightforward.</li>

                                </li>

                                            with delays when clicking on items, and getting lost in the navigation at
                                            times.</li>
                                        <li>UI Design Confusion: Confusion with certain UI elements, such as icons for
                                            amenities, and the layout of the site view screen.</li>
                                        <li>Keyboard Overlapping: Issues with the keyboard blocking important UI

                                            weather and clearer distinction for favorited sites on the map.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
