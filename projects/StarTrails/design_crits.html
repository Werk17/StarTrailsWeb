							<h1>Design Crits</h1>

							<div class="MuiBox-root css-m507i9">
								<p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-lj8hfv">

								</p>
							</div>

							<p>After developing a reliable and detailed prototype, our objective was to assess the
								performance of fellow classmates and potential end users of our application as they
								engaged in various standard tasks using our prototype. Our focus was on identifying
								areas where they encountered questions, issues, or concerns with our design. Presented
								below are the scenarios and tasks we presented to our classmates during the
								high-fidelity design critique session, along with key feedback collected and a
								discussion on how it will shape our upcoming design iterations.
							</p>

							<h2>Scenario 1</h2>

							<p>You have decided to take a trip to eastern montana to go stargazing. You heard of a new
								recreation app on the market called StarTrails. You decide to download the app in hopes
								of finding a quiet and remote campground with minimal light pollution to view the stars.
								You also wish to know if there are any expected meteor showers or northern lights and
								what restaurants are nearby so you have a place to stop and grab breakfast on the way
								home. </p>
							<h4>Tasks:</h4>
							<ol>
								<li>Login
									<br> a. Register a new account (UF.P.1)
									<br> b. Change your profile picture (UF.P.3)
								</li>
								<li>Access the light pollution map
									<br> a. Find a site in a remote area with minimal light pollution (UF.D.8)(UF.D.1)
									<br> b. Favorite the site for later viewing (UF.F.3)
								</li>
								<li>Access the Celestial Events Calendar
									<br> a. Find if there are any meteor showers during the time of your visit (UF.D.14)
									<br> b. Find if there are any expected northern lights viewing (UF.D.15)
									<br> c. Check the KP index (northern lights magnitude) of the earth (UF.D.7)
									<br> d. Set a notification reminder (UF.S.1)
								</li>
								<li>View favorited sites
									<br> a. Find your most recent favorited camp spot (UF.P.3)
									<br> b. Check if the site offers camping (UF.D.4)
									<br> c. Find a nearby campground to lodge at (UF.D.11)
									<br> d. Find a nearby restaurant you can visit in the morning (UF.D.10)
								</li>
								<li>Share feedback on the site
									<br> a. Leave a review for the site (UF.C.1)
								</li>
							</ol>
							<br>

							<h2>Scenario 2</h2>

							<p>After staying at a campsite you realize that some of the information on your new favorite
								app about the site is either incorrect or out of date. To resolve this, you decide to
								leave comments with some information on your review of the site.</p>
							<h4>Tasks:</h4>
							<ol>
								<li>Sign In
									<br> a. Enter username and password into login screen and verify existence and
									correctness of inputs (UF.P.2)
								</li>
								<li>Navigate to Site on app
									<br> a. Either pull up site from list (UF.F.1)
									<br> b. or navigate to site on interactive map(UF.M.1)
								</li>
								<li>Leave a review on the site
									<br> a. Fill out review and leave info in comment (UF.C.1)
									<br> b. Verify review posted and see if other reviews have left similar info(UF.D.2)
								</li>
							</ol>


							<h2>Summary of Feedback from In-Class Design Crits</h2>

							<p>Below is a list of the most common feedback we received during our design crit session
								using our high-fidelity prototype. </p>
							<ul>
								<li>Bottom navigation buttons are too large</li>
								<li>Switch the home page with the compass (discovery) page and move the discovery page
									to the home page</li>
								<li>Place the KP index description before the KP index forecast to clear up confusion
									for non-astronomy users</li>
								<li>Replace the stars on the map with pins</li>
								<li>Increase the font size on the KP index description for more quality user
									friendliness </li>
								<li>Add a key to the map so the user knows which overlay they currently have toggled
								</li>
								<li>Aurora Borealis button may be confusing to non-astronomy users so change the button
									content to Northern Lights for clarity </li>
								<li>Create uniformity by having a uniform favorited sites icon rather than a bookmarked
									and favorited sites </li>
							</ul>

							To demonstrate the influence of this feedback on subsequent design iterations, we have
							incorporated annotated screen shots highlighting the identified issues. Some issues we
							resolved right away and described the changes we made while other issues we accompanied with
							an explanation of our planned resolution for each specific problem in our future endeavors.

							<div class="MuiGrid-root MuiGrid-item MuiGrid-grid-md-6 css-gp0h3g">
								<div class="MuiBox-root css-1vp8jwk">

									<div class="MuiBox-root css-1j8t7mm">
										<div
											class="MuiPaper-root MuiPaper-elevation MuiPaper-rounded MuiPaper-elevation1 css-1lnqg4h">
											<center><img src="./images/crit1.png"
													style="max-height:400px;max-width:100%">
												<figcaption style="font-size: 14px;">

												<img src="./images/crit3.png" style="max-height:400px;max-width:100%">
											</center>
											<figcaption style="font-size: 14px;">
												<center><em>Annotated Home and Profile Screens</em></center>
											</figcaption>

											<p>The screens above cover the majority of important feedback we gathered
												from our high-fidelity prototype design crits. Our group immediately
												implemented a few important changes such as changing our navigation
												button sizes and switching our bookmarked sites buttons with a favorite
												button. Our group left out some feedback but described the changes in
												the above picture. Going forward to implementation we plan to
												incorporate as many, if not all of our feedback we gathered from our
												design crits session. Overall, the feedback we were given will be
												crucial for our interface design going forward. We strive to give our
												app a user-friendly look and feel while also creating and utilizing all
												of our core functionality we described in our Reqs Spec session.</p>
