							<h1>User Feedback</h1>

							<p>The primary focus of our early design was to determine what users would expect from our
								app based on the concept alone. We wanted to know what tools the user
								would want to be equipped with in order to achieve whichever goal they had in mind when
								they downloaded our hypothetical app. Overall
								we were looking at features which needed to be added, and how they could be placed
								within our application in an appealing manner. </p>

							<h2>Method</h2>
							<p> Our method of gathering early feedback was a combination of in class constructive
								feedback activities, and questionnaires to potential users.
								These questionnaires were given out via a Google Forms document as this makes it not
								only easy to get to potential users, but google forms provides also
								analysis tools which make gathering feedback and drawing conclusions more
								straightforward. </p>

							<h2>Sample Questions</h2>
							<p> The questions we gave users were geared towards finding out how they would use our
								application and how they were currently dealing with the problem we were trying to
								solve.
								We aimed to figure out how they were currently discovering local music, if they were
								satisfied with their current methods, and how they would intend to use our application
								based on a
								short prompt describing what our proposed app would look like. We wanted to know how
								users planned to utilize our application, in order to be able to design giggle with our
								users' experience in mind.
								Some sample questions from our feedback sessions are included below: </p>
							<ul>
								<li><i>“How do you normally discover live music events in your area?”</i></li>
								<li><i>“Are you satisfied with the options for discovery that are currently
										available?”</i></li>
								<li><i>“Would you be interested in using an app to more easily find people to jam
										with?”</i></li>

							</ul>


							<h2">Key Insights</h2>

								<p>
									<b>1. Users seemed to favor more of a social media aspect to our application
									</b><br>
									While giggle's aim is to provide a platform to find local music, bands, and
									musicians user
									pointed out that this could be achieved in a social media type app. Not only did
									they want to find local music,
									but they also wanted to be able to share that experience with their friends through
									giggle.
								</p>

								<p><b>2. Not all of our initial ideas were going to make the final cut</b><br>
									During initial discussion of our application, some potential functionality was
									planned that was either out of the scope of this project,
									or undesired among potential users.
								</p>

								<p>
									<b>3. There was no current option for finding music that was agreed upon by all
										users </b><br>
									Based off of user feedback, there was no clear one option currently available for
									finding local music events. Most current options
									appeared to be posted by vague groups on already established social media platforms,
									and word of mouth.
								</p>
