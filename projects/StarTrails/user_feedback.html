							<h1>User Feedback</h1>

							<p>The primary focus of our early design was to determine what users would expect from our
								app based on the concept alone. We wanted to know what tools the user
								would want to be equipped with in order to achieve whichever goal they had in mind when
								they downloaded our hypothetical app. Overall
								we were looking at features which needed to be added, and how they could be placed
								within our application in an appealing manner. </p>

							<h2>Method</h2>
							<p> An important aspect in our development cycle is to gather feedback from potential users
								early, and often. Before we defined any functionality or features, we spent time
								collecting data on what potential users wanted out of a stargazing app. Our user
								feedback was gathered through the use of a curated survey we distributed to different
								groups of potential users and 30 minute interviews conducted by our team members. We
								created 12 interview questions and 16 survey questions which assisted our team in
								answering some of the questions regarding which features we would like to implement and
								what potential users wanted to see in a stargazing app.</p>

							<h2>Summary</h2>
							<p>From the data we collected during our user-feedback gathering, we found our potential
								user base would like to see many different features implemented in our app. From our
								data collection, we found the majority of our participants are Montana residents (54 /
								56) with the exception of 2 who stated they are not. As far as the type of phones they
								possess, the majority of them are Apple users (57%) and the rest stated they use Android
								as their platform. However, with more data, we can assume those numbers would move
								closer to 50/50 of Android/Apple users. The frequency of stargazing for most of our
								participants is split between monthly and weekly visits with just a few that prefer
								daily and annually. Approximately 73% of participants reported that they used a
								stargazing app before. Furthermore, 71% of these participants would use an app to locate
								stargazing sites. </p>

							<h2>Sample Questions</h2>
							<p> The questions we gave users were geared towards finding out how they would use our
								application and how they were currently dealing with the problem we were trying to
								solve. Our aim was to seek those who are interested in stargazing and what sort of
								technologies they use to plan out their next stargazing trip.
								Some sample questions from our feedback sessions are included below: </p>
							<ul>
								<li><i>“What information would you find useful in a stargazing app?”</i></li>
								<li><i>“What features would be most useful in a Stargazing App?”</i></li>
								<li><i>“Would you be more inclined to visit a recreation site if you were aware the site
										was a designated Night Sky viewing site?”</i></li>

							</ul>


							<h2>Key Insights</h2>

							<p>
								<b>1. Astronomical Event Notifications
								</b><br>
								Astronomical Event Notifications are events such as meteor showers, auroras, solar
								eclipses, and other related events that are sent to the user's device. The majority
								of our responses agree that astronomical events would be the most useful
								information in a stargazing app among other features.
							</p>

							<p><b>2. Weather and Live Updates</b><br>
								Weather and cloud-cover are two of the most important factors in planning a stargazing
								trip. A large number of our interviewees said that the most challenging aspect of
								planning a stargazing trip more than a few weeks out is the unpredictable weather and
								the potential for a cloud covered sky when you arrive to the site. Many of the responses
								report that they are interested in a feature that can provide live
								weather updates and/or projected cloud cover in the future.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>3. Designated Night Sky Viewing Site</b><br>
								Approximately 80% of our survey responses and a few of our interviews suggest that they
								would be more inclined to visit a recreation site if it was designated as an official
								night sky viewing site. One of the most suggested features was the directions to a
								stargazing site of their choosing.
