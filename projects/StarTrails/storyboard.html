							<h1>Storyboard (Low-fidelity prototype)</h1>

							<div class="MuiBox-root css-m507i9">
								<p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-lj8hfv">Using the information we
									gathered from our users and the resulting list of high-priority functional
									requirements we subsequently indentified, we then set our to create a low-fidelity
									prototype. Using pen and paper, our team created different sketches on what we as a
									development team believe our app should look like. The Low-Fidelity Prototyping
									phase is incredibly useful for our
									development cycle, as it allows us to brainstorm different conceptual ideas we may
									have onto paper and gather feedback on which design aspects may work the best for
									our application. Although this level of prototyping is useful for early user
									interface brainstorming, we are constrained on basic interface functionality and
									general operating systems look and feel.
								</p>
								<p>Below are some annotated sketches of our low-fidelity prototype. They illustrate ...

											<p>
												Above are the first of the similarities in our designs, which is the
												login and registration pages. It is no surprise that they are similar
												because it is pretty standard
												and everyone is probably used to them by now.

											<figcaption style="font-size: 14px;">
												<center><em>Home Page Sketches</em></center>
											</figcaption>
											<p>
												Here is where I designs start to diverge, but we still have similar
												ideas but with different placement and styles for our elements. Here are
												a few examples:
											</p>
											<ul>
												<li>A location indicator at the top of the screen</li>
												<li>Hamburger menu on the top right of the screen</li>
												<li>Block elements for each event listing</li>
											</ul>
											<p>We decided that the first design (pictured on the upper left) had all of
												the aspects that
												we wanted to include in our prototype. We set out to follow that design,
												and determine later on
												whether or not we wanted to make changes to the initial sketches. This
												initial design had some more
												functionality that we wanted to see included, such as the navigation bar
												at the bottom and a better
												utilization of space from the event blocks. The bottom sketches are what
												the user would see when
												they clicked on eny given event. The event view would later house some
												of the most important information
												on the app. The main goal is to give users a place to find events, and
												we decided that we
												wanted to implement these early sketches into our app.
